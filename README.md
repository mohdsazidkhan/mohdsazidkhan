About Me
Hello! I'm Mohd Sazid Khan, a passionate and innovative engineer with a deep love for building impactful digital products. With years of hands-on experience in web and app development, I specialize in crafting modern, scalable, and user-friendly solutions using technologies like React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS.

Over time, I’ve developed a strong foundation in full-stack development, API design, and UI/UX principles. My focus has always been on writing clean, maintainable code and delivering efficient, real-world applications. Whether it's a startup idea, a client project, or one of my own ventures, I bring the same level of dedication and attention to detail.

I’m the creator of SUBG QUIZ – Play Quizzes, Level Up, Win Prizes. Convert to Cash!, a fun and engaging quiz platform tailored for all age groups. From kids and students to working professionals and retirees, SUBG QUIZ is designed to challenge minds while providing a rewarding experience. It started as a coin-based quiz app and has now evolved into a subscription-based model with multi-level quizzes, where users can enjoy both free and premium content.

I’m also the developer behind Kuexa, a platform tailored for salons, helping service providers manage appointments, track performance, and improve customer experience through smart digital solutions. Whether it's customer-facing UI or backend systems, I’ve worked on every aspect of these products from scratch.

In addition to my technical skills, I believe in clear communication and continuous learning. I stay updated with the latest trends in web technologies, UI frameworks, and AI-powered tools like Kaiber, Pika, and GPT-based systems, which I actively explore to push creative boundaries—especially in my storytelling and kids animation projects like “ChuChu Bandar aur Jadui Chappal.”

I’m currently building my personal portfolio and brand, where I showcase my projects and experiments in modern web design. I enjoy creating responsive, animated, and dark/light mode–compatible websites that reflect both function and aesthetics. My design philosophy is heavily inspired by minimalism, gradient visuals, and Apple-style animations that captivate users from the first interaction.

Beyond code, I’m curious, focused, and driven by the idea of creating something meaningful. Every project I take on is an opportunity to solve real-world problems while learning something new. I'm always open to collaborating with like-minded creatives, startups, or companies aiming to bring their vision to life.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to check out my work, connect with me, or drop a message—let’s build something amazing together.
